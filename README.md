# Practical Sessions on Probabilistic Models and Bayesian Inference

This repository contains the work and code for three practical sessions focused on applying probabilistic models and Bayesian inference to real-world problems. Each session explores specific methods and algorithms through hands-on programming in R.
Overview of the Sessions

    1: Simulation and Sampling Methods
    Introduction to joint distributions and conditional probabilities. Students explore simulation techniques, implement rejection and Gibbs sampling algorithms, and apply linear regression to analyze the results.

    2: Change Point Detection in Binary Sequences
    Application of probabilistic models to detect changes in binary sequences. This session emphasizes statistical inference and the development of algorithms for real-world signal analysis.

    3: Bayesian Inference for Predictive Decision-Making
    Focus on Bayesian methods to compute posterior distributions and predictive probabilities. The session applies these concepts to make informed decisions under uncertainty.


Requirements
